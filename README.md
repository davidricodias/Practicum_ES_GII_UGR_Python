## FAQ

- **Q** : I want to change the text color and the background color

- **A** : You just need to go to the file `main.tex` and comment the lines
  ```latex
  \pagecolor{black}
  \color{white}
  ```
  This will enable the default option: white background and black text.
- **Q** : How do I compile the LaTex document?
- **A** : I highly recommend using [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com); it includes all the packages needed and the XeLaTex compiler. However, the packages needed are written at the beggining of `main.tex`, so you can compile on your own.
